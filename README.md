CoDEX — Core Rulebook (High-Level)

A tactical, turn-based “Core battler” where you are an Operator building teams of modular Cores. Battles are 1v1 with 3 Cores per side. Moves are played like cards, fueled by shared team resources generated each turn by dice rolls.

1. The Premise

In CoDEX, you play as an Operator—a commander, mechanic, and strategist in one. You don’t fight directly. Instead, you build and maintain a roster of Cores: modular combat frames that can be tuned, upgraded, and customized.

Your primary loop is:

Acquire new Cores (randomly generated with optional paid “locks”)

Build teams and equip move decks in your Garage

Battle other Operators (AI or players)

Earn loot, currency, and experience

Upgrade and refine your roster

Decommission old Cores to make room (and potentially reclaim them later)

CoDEX is designed to feel like:

Pokémon team battles (3 units per side)

MTG-style card play and resource management

Metabots/Armored Core roster tuning and garage culture

2. Key Objects in the World
   Operator

You are the persistent identity across the whole game.

An Operator tracks:

Level (meta progression)

Wins / Losses

Bits (currency)

Premium (optional premium currency, if monetized)

Zones (where you’ve been / unlocked areas)

Choices (permanent or semi-permanent narrative decisions)

Garage (your roster and equipment storage)

Design intent: The Operator is progression + ownership. Your Cores can be scrapped, replaced, rebuilt. Your Operator is the “you” that persists.

Core

A Core is a combat unit. It’s a frame, not a character, but players are expected to bond with them like characters.

Each Core has:

Rarity (affects power ceiling and generation rules)

Type Identity (like “Commander color identity”—affects what moves it can use)

Level / EXP (growth over time)

Battle stats

Upgrade tracks (how it grows and what it tends toward)

A move deck (pool) + equipped move slots

Decommissioned state (whether it’s currently active or scrapped)

Design intent: Cores are both collectible and buildable. Randomness creates variety; tracks create identity; deck-building creates mastery.

Moves (Cards)

A Move is a playable action. Moves behave like cards:

They have a resource cost

They have a damage type (Energy Ammo or Physical Ammo)

They can have accuracy, effects, or special timing rules

They belong to a Core’s move pool (deck) but only a few can be equipped for battle

Design intent: Moves create the strategic layer. The same Core can play differently based on its equipped kit.

Garage

The Garage is your base of operations. It contains:

Your active Cores (limited by capacity)

Your equipment

Your saved team loadouts (pre-built teams of 3 Cores)

The tools to equip/un-equip moves and manage builds

Garages have Bay Doors:

Bay Doors = Core capacity

When you exceed capacity, you must decommission an old Core to make room or buy more bays.

Design intent: Capacity forces meaningful decisions. You can’t hoard everything. You curate your roster.

Scrapyard

The Scrapyard is where decommissioned Cores go.

Functions:

Recommission old Cores for a cost

Access rotating offers (items, bundles, weekly deals) if the economy expands later

Recommissioned Cores:

Return to your Garage roster

Start at Level 1 (by default)

Design intent: Decommissioning has weight, but not permanent tragedy. You can “bring them back,” but it costs.

Cyber Codex

The Cyber Codex is your Core creation chamber.

In the Codex, you:

“Spin up” a new Core frame

Accept random generation OR pay to lock certain attributes

Choose art/palette variations

Place it into an open bay, or replace an existing Core (decommissioning the old one)

Design intent: This is the acquisition/gacha-adjacent system—but tuned to preserve player agency and reduce “pure luck” frustration.

3. Game Flow and Screens
   Screen: Cyber Codex (Acquire)

Purpose: Generate new Cores.

Typical flow:

Choose “Generate Core”

Core rolls:

Rarity

Type identity

Stat profile

Track profile

Starter move pool

Optional: pay Bits to lock attributes (tracks/type/etc.)

Select a Core image (palette shifts or predefined art)

If Garage has capacity: Core is stored

If full: choose a bay to replace → replaced Core is decommissioned

Screen: Garage (Build)

Purpose: Prepare for battle.

Actions:

View roster of active Cores

Equip/unequip moves (slot-limited)

View move pools (deck) and learned moves

Create and save team loadouts (3 cores each)

Buy Bay Doors to increase capacity

Decommission Cores (to free space)

Screen: Battle (Play)

Purpose: Execute combat.

Actions:

Select a team loadout (3 Cores)

Enter battle against an opponent

Play cards (moves) using shared team resources

Win → receive rewards (loot, bits, exp)

Loss → smaller payout or consolation, depending on mode

Screen: Scrapyard (Recycle / Restore)

Purpose: Manage decommissioned roster and economy.

Actions:

Recommission old decommissioned Cores (cost)

Review weekly deal (optional system)

Buy bundles/items (optional system)

4. Combat Rule Set (Locked-In Version)
   Team Structure

Battles are 1v1

Each side brings 3 Cores

Only one Core is “active” at a time (core vs core), but team resources are shared

(You can expand later into tag switching, zone positioning, etc. But the baseline is: active core fights while the team supports via shared resources and future design space.)

Resources: Energy Ammo & Physical Ammo

CoDEX uses two team-shared resource pools:

Energy Ammo
Used for energy-based attacks, shields, tech, systems, and utilities.

Physical Ammo
Used for kinetic attacks, heavy strikes, ballistic systems, and physical pressure.

These pools are:

Shared by your whole team

Visible to both players

Spent to play move cards

Turn Start: Resource Roll

At the start of each turn:

Each Core on your team rolls a d8

For each roll, you assign the result to one of:

Energy Ammo pool

Physical Ammo pool

This produces a “resource budget” for the turn.

Why this works

There’s randomness, so no game is solved

But players control allocation, so skill matters

You get meaningful tension:

“Do I load energy for defense now?”

“Do I stack physical to threaten a kill?”

Moves as Cards (Deck + Slots)

Each Core has:

A move pool (the deck of moves it can potentially use)

A limited number of equip slots (typically 4)

Only equipped moves are usable in battle.

Move cards generally have:

A cost in one resource type (Energy or Physical)

Accuracy (optional)

A damage value (optional)

A card type (Attack / Defense / Reaction / Support / Stance / Utility)

Action Freedom (MTG-like sequencing)

Within your turn:

You may play equipped move cards in any order

As long as you can pay their resource costs

And as long as timing rules allow it

This creates:

MTG-like sequencing (“hold resources and respond”)

Pokémon-like identity and unit kits

Without forcing the strict “one move per turn” limit

Interrupts and Reactions (Supported)

Some cards are Reactions:

These can trigger during an opponent’s actions, under defined conditions

They cost resources like any other card

They punish predictable lines and reward planning

Design intent: Interactivity without full MTG stack complexity.

Victory Rewards

When you defeat an enemy team of 3 Cores:

Gain random loot

Gain Bits

Gain EXP on participating Cores

Trigger possible:

Level-ups

Unlocks (like Bay Doors if milestones are hit)

5. Core Generation Rules (Cyber Codex Logic)
   Rarity

There are 5 rarity tiers. Rarity affects:

Stat range at level 1

Growth curve ceiling

Whether the Core is fully random or curated

Mythic/Epic (highest tier)

Not random

Named

Comes from pre-made templates

Has multiple kit setups

Design intent: You get both “procedural variety” and “chase identities.”

Type Identity (Commander-style lock)

Each Core has a Type Identity.
Moves may have a required identity tag.

Example rule:

A “Defender” Core can equip Defender/Neutral moves

It cannot equip “Pyro-only” moves unless explicitly allowed

Design intent: Strong archetypes and clear lanes.

Tracks (The “Soul” of a Core)

Tracks are how you create variety and long-term identity.

Common track families:

Damage Track: biases toward Energy or Physical damage kits

Fortitude Track: fast/weak vs slow/strong vs balanced templates

Growth Track: fast early scaling vs steady vs late bloomers

(Optional later) Utility/Control tracks

Tracks influence:

Stat weighting

Move pool weighting

Growth rates

Design intent: Two Rare cores can be completely different, even at the same level.

6. Decommissioning and Roster Pressure

Your Garage has limited capacity.
Therefore:

New cores are exciting

But keeping them requires a decision

Decommissioning

Marks a Core as inactive/scrapped

Frees bay capacity

Sends a record to the Scrapyard

Recommissioning

Allows an old Core back (for a cost)

Resets it to Level 1 (baseline rule)

Lets players “recover” mistakes but still feel consequences

Design intent: This is what creates emotional gameplay in a collection system. You aren’t just collecting—you’re curating.

7. What’s intentionally left flexible (future expansion)

This rulebook locks your “behind combat” game and your combat pillars, but leaves room for:

Switching active cores mid-battle (tag mechanics)

Status effects / debuffs / buffs

Zone progression (campaign map)

Choice consequences (story nodes)

Equipment affecting stats/decks

PvP ladder vs PvE modes

Mythic templates and seasonal drops

8. The One-Paragraph Pitch (for your README)

CoDEX is a turn-based Core battler where you play an Operator managing a roster of modular Cores. Battles are 1v1 with 3 Cores per side, and actions are played as card-like moves fueled by shared team resources generated each turn through d8 rolls. Between battles you curate your roster in the Garage, equip and swap move kits, and make hard decisions when your limited bay capacity forces you to decommission old Cores—knowing you can reclaim them later through the Scrapyard at a cost. The Cyber Codex lets you spin up new frames with procedural variety while preserving player agency through optional attribute locks and cosmetic customization.
